## Problem 1:
# Ask a user for the year they were born by calculating their age.
# Assuming they already had their birthday and it’s 2019 print “You are [AGE] years old”

# userage =
# userInput = input("what year were your born?")
# if userInput



# Problem 2:
# Ask the user for a string.
# If they enter “Kenn”, “Kevin”, “Erin”, or “Autumn” print “Hello Teacher”.
# Otherwise print “Hello Student”

# userInput = input("Enter some peoples names")
# if userInput == "Kevin":
#     print("Hello Teacher")
# else:
#     print("Hello Student")



# Problem 3:
# Ask the user for a negative number.
# Print from 7 down to the user's negative number.
# You must include the user's number.

# userInput = int(input("Enter a negative number"))
# for userInput in range(7, userInput - 1, -1):
#     print(userInput)


# Problem 4:
# Ask the user to enter a number between -10 to -5.
# If their input is not between the two numbers ask them to do it
# again until they get it right. Afterward they print the correct number, print "Good job"

# userInput = ""
# while userInput != -10:
#     userInput = int(input("Enter a number between -10 to -5"))

# print("Good Job")

# Problem 5:
# Create the list: squad = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"].
# Print the list in reverse without using a list method.




# Problem 6:
# Create a function that will have the string firstName as a parameter.
# In the function ask the user for their last name.
# Print "Hello [FIRST & LAST NAME]" in the function. Call that function

def name(firstName):
    firstName = LaVar
    userInput = input("Whats is your Last name")
    print(f'Hello {firstName + userInput}')

name(firstName)	
# Problem 7:
# Create the class Books with name, rating, genre, and author properties/attributes.
# Create a class method that will change the rating of the book.
# Outside of the class, create three objects of the class Book and put them in an array.
# Lastly, USING THE ARRAY print only the names of the books using any method we’ve learned in class.




# Problem 8:
# Create a function that asks the user to enter a number.
# If the number is between and include -50 and 5, return "Funds too low".
# If the number is between 5 and 50, return “You should add more funds.”
# If the number is more than 50, return “Just enough.”



# Problem 9:
# Ask the user for a positive number.
# Create an empty array and starting from zero, add each number by 1 into the array.
# Print EACH ELEMENT of the array.



# Problem 10:
# Create a new empty array called pet_list.
# Create a Pet class with a type and breed attribute/property.
# Include a method that will print each attribute/property.
# Add 3 pet objects to the pet_list array. Print the attributes/properties for each pet.
